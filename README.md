Cat and Dog Image Classifier
Description
This project is a deep learning-based image classifier that distinguishes between images of cats and dogs. It uses convolutional neural networks (CNN) to achieve high accuracy in image classification tasks.

Features
Utilizes CNNs for image classification.
Trained on a substantial dataset of cat and dog images.
Provides high accuracy in distinguishing between cat and dog images.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/DebiPrasadMohanty/Deep-Learning-Projects.git
cd Deep-Learning-Projects/Cat\ and\ Dog\ Image\ Classifier
Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the dataset and place it in the appropriate directory (provide specific instructions or a link if necessary).

Usage
To train the model, run:

bash
Copy code
python train.py
To evaluate the model, run:

bash
Copy code
python evaluate.py
To use the model for prediction on new images, run:

bash
Copy code
python predict.py --image_path path_to_image
